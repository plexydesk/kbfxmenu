		<title>KBFX History</title>

		<para>
			KBFX was started on June 5th 2005 as a hobbyist project by Siraj Razick, born out of a spontaneous idea.
		</para>

		<para>
			The reason was that Siraj didn't like the old K-Menu, which was quite a clone of the old Win95 Start menu. So he started coding.
			The first step provided merely the possibility to call the K-Menu via a button, that could have a different shape and size than the original K-Menu button, which has always been an icon of a square size. To change the default KBFX button, one still had to copy an image file to a certain location.
			After the first post in mid-June 05, KBFX has spread rapidly and it was nice to see that until end of June, there were already a dozen posts on kde-look with buttons and builds.
		</para>

		<para>
			Mensur Zahirovic (called Nookie) joined Siraj on 5th of august, after Siraj met him on yahoo. Nookie is responsible for the Web-development and the Q&#038;A. He also arranged the site www.kbfx.org, that replaces the previous site www.linuxlots.com/~siraj/plugin/kde.
		</para>

		<para>
			After that, things began to speed up.
			Now KBFX is no longer just another button design for the K-Menu, but provides an alternative to it, that is in fact more sophisticated than the XP-Start menu.
		</para>
	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="kbfx-development">
		<title>KBFX Development</title>

		<para>
			KBFX version 0.4.9.3 is a complete rewrite of the old KBFX code eliminating all the negative points of the previous versions.
		</para>

		<para>
			At the start we had a list of end requirements for version 0.4.9.3 and we developed each of the feature units, testing each and every class as it was developed.
			Apart from unit testing, the quality assurance managers periodically checked the quality of the product and the new releases that were made to the KBFX source repository.
			The Q&#038;A always checked the product against the requirements that we had set to maximize quality.
			This way of development helped us to discover tons of bugs and fix them instantly, and so we debut with a rather clean and bug free KBFX.
		</para>

		<para>
			It was really helpful to see many users around the world checking out the development release of KBFX from SVN, reporting and posting problems encountered and helping to add more stability and compatibility between distributions.
			Because of this, we know the supported platforms even before KBFX is 0.4.9.3 is released.
		</para>

		<para>
			KBFX has been tested to work with all GCC3.x and GCC4.x compilers.
			It has been tested on systems running the distributions of Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu, Suse, Slackware, Mango, Mandrake, PCLinuxOS and Fedora core.
			Unfortunately, compiling on FreeBSD systems is yet to be tested, but we plan to port KBFX to FreeBSD and PcBSD.
		</para>
	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="kbfx-concepts">
		<title>KBFX Concepts</title>

		<para>
			The KBFX Spinx Menu does not try to copy the WinXP Start menu.
			It is based on a different approach and concept.
			Following, the concepts of the traditional hierarchical structure and the new, flat indexed menu are described and compared, although the new menu structure is quite intuitive.
		</para>

		<para>&#160;</para>

		<sect2>
			<title>Hierarchical (Traditional) menu structure</title>

			<para>
				The KDE K-Menu is a good example of a flat hierarchical menu.
				It organizes application shortcuts in a tree link structure, where it can expand and open a submenu, with entries displayed based on some logical order.
				This order may be task oriented, type oriented or just ordered alphabetically.
				To find and launch an application, the user needs to navigate through the submenus, until he reaches the leaf (leaf node).
				This approach is a direct adoption of the Microsoft Windows Start Menu. They introduced it with Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000. This was certainly a huge usability advantage compared to the Windows 3.1 System with the program manager, but a lot has changed since these days. The Windows XP Start Menu is still based on this concept, although it is enhanced by the functionalities to pin applications to the left column and the automatically pinned most used applications.
				But still, a user must move the mouse over the half screen, if his menu has many submenus with other submenus, and the application is not one of his most used or pinned applications.
			</para>

			<para>&#160;</para>
		</sect2>


		<sect2>
			<title>Flat indexed menu structure</title>

			<para>
				The KBFX Spinx Menu uses a different approach – the flat indexed menu.
				With this type of menu it's very easy to navigate.
				On the left hand side, you are given the application categories.
				They can be task oriented or type oriented. On the right (middle) side of the menu, there are all the available applications listed that belong to the activated category.
				The advantage is evident - the menu reduces the mouse paths, so you can locate your applications very fast. The user sees all the categories at a glance and he can pick it without having to travel along a long list until he finds the end leaf.
				The speed of use is further enhanced by moving the most used and recently used applications on the top index, so that the most used applications are just one click away.

			The KBFX menu button is a starting point for the menu. It first has to be added to a kicker's panel.
			To add the KBFX Menu to a panel, proceed as following:
		</para>

		<procedure>
			<step>
				<para>
					Right-click on the kicker's panel, on which you want to place the KBFX button.
				</para>
			</step>

			<step>

			<step>
				<para>
					A tooltip appears "KBFX Spinx Added".
				</para>

				Every theme MAY have two configuration files named:
			</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<link linkend="kbfx-kbfxfontrc">kbfxfontrc</link> - configures the fonts properties that the theme uses.
					</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>
						<link linkend="kbfx-kbfxlayoutrc">kbfxlayoutrc</link> - configures the layout of the theme, the KBFX button and some other properties of the theme.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>


			<para>
				If one or both of these files don't exist, KBFX internal configuration
				options will be used for fonts and layout.
				All the properties and values are separated between different Sections
				in the way showed below:
			</para>

			<literallayout>
	[Section]
	property = value
			</literallayout>

			<para>
				When you want to prepare a theme, have in mind that every change that you make in the "KBFX Configurator" is kept in files in your home KDE directory.
			</para>

			<para>
				Usually these files are in the folder <emphasis>~/.kde/share/apps/kbfx/themerc</emphasis>
				and are named:

					<para>
						THEMENAME_fontrc
					</para>
				</listitem>

			<para>
				So if you want to ship your theme settings from the "KBFX Configurator", the best
				thing to do is to use the buttons:
				"EXPORT KBFXFONTRC FILE" (<link linkend="kbfx_fonts">"Fonts" section of the Configurator</link>)
				and
				"EXPORT KBFXLAYOUTRC FILE" (<link linkend="kbfx_layout">"Layout section" of the Configurator</link>)
