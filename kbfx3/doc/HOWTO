How to apply the Menu button
============================

The menu button is starting point for the menu.
It first has to be added to the panel.
To add the KBFX Menu to the panel, proceed as following:
  Right-click on the panel, on which you want to place the KBFX button
  Select "Add Applet to panel" in the context menu
  Select "KBFX Spinx"
A tooltip appears "KBFX Spinx Added"
If you move your mouse over the button, a tooltip appears (turned off
in the default configuration).
If you want to, you can now remove the K-Menu button and move the KBFX
to the desired place on the panel.
To open the menu, just click on the button.



How to create themes for KBFX 0.4.9.3
=====================================

So you want to create your own themes for KBFX 0.4.9.3?
The guide is done in a simple manner and we hope that you will easily and
simply create themes for KBFX 0.4.9.3. If you don't like something in this
guide, please feel free to contact us at IRC on irc.freenode.org

      - In order to be used by the Configurator and by KBFX, every theme for
        0.4.9.3 MUST HAVE a file in it's folder named "version-2" !

How to write theme's kbfxfontrc and kbfxlayoutrc files
======================================================

  Every theme MAY have two configuration files named:

kbfxfontrc - configures the fonts properties that the theme uses
kbfxlayoutrc - configures the layout of the theme, the KBFX button
               and some other properties of the theme

  If one or both of these files don't exist, KBFX internal configuration
options will be used for fonts and layout.
  All the properties and values are separated between different Sections
in the way showed below:

[Section]
property = value

  When you want to prepare a theme, have in mind that every change that you
make in the "KBFX Configurator" is kept in files in your home KDE directory.
Usually these files are here:
	~/.kde/share/apps/kbfx/themerc
and are named:
	THEMENAME_layoutrc
	THEMENAME_fontrc
So if you want to ship your theme settings from the "KBFX Configurator", the best
thing to do is to use the buttons: "EXPORT KBFXFONTRC FILE" ("Fonts" section of the
Configurator) and "EXPORT KBFXLAYOUTRC FILE" ("Layout section" of the Configurator)
and put the exported files in your theme folder.

NOTE:  - Pay close attention to the case of the properties and Sections names
	 because the configuration is CASE SENSITIVE!
       - The order of the sections in the file is not important!
       - Have in mind that the Layout of the theme also depends on the sizes of
         the images!

 File version-2
 --------------

 This file is obligatory to exist, though it can be empty.
 It is used to designate that the theme is in the new format and the
 properties that are in the file are used in the KBFX Configurator for
 showing the user some info about the theme.
 The values in this file cannot be overwritten by the KBFX Configurator.
 If existing, the file should contain information about the theme's version,
 author's name, author's email and a homepage for the theme.
 The unspecified fields are replaced with the string - "Not Specified".
 The values bellow are self explanatory and are just an example:

  [ThemeGeneral]
  ThemeVersion=0.51
  AuthorName=Nookie
  AuthorEmail=nookie@no_spam.org
  Homepage=http://www.kbfx.org



 How to create a ".kbfxtheme" file for 0.4.9.3
 =============================================

The ".kbfxtheme" file is a simple archive file (.tar.gz or .tar.bz2) that should
contain at least these elements:
- one or more theme folders with all the necessary images/files inside. Have in mind
  that the name of the theme is the name of the folder.
- in the theme(s) folder(s) there should be an image named preview.png that serves
  as a live preview of the look of the theme.
- in the theme(s) folder(s) there should be a file named version-2
- the extension of the archive should be ".kbfxtheme"

You can create ".kbfxtheme" file following these instructions (there is
an option in Konqueror's rightclick "Actions" menu for preparing KBFX Theme Package
OR you can create the ".kbfxtheme" file manually as described bellow):
- Create a folder with a name that is identical to the name you want for your theme.
- Put the necessary images/files inside it (see the above instructions for the images part).
- Create an archive of the folder (with ark/tar etc).
- Rename the archive file to ".kbfxtheme" and you are ready.


 How to help us out
 ==================

You can help us for the KBFX releases with the translation of the interface.
For this purpose please download the kbfxconfigapp.pot file from SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=141258&package_id=210120 .
Another way to get a .pot file is to use the command "make package-messages"
just after the configuration of the compilation process is done.
Then use KBabel (http://kbabel.kde.org/) or poEdit (http://www.poedit.org/) to make the translation.
Next send the .po file to my mail - phobosk@mail.kbfx.org
Thanks in advance for this help.
