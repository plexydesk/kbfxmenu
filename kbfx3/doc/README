 KBFX Preface:
 ============
  KBFX is an alternative to the classical K-Menu button and it's menu.
It improves the user experience by enabling the user to set a bigger (and
thus more visible) start button and by finally replacing the Win95-like
K-Menu with the Spinx bar.
If you still want the old menu, because you're used to it, it is still
available as an option in KBFX.
