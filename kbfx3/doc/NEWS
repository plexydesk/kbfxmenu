"KBFX Silk" (0.4.9.3.1)
=======================

Hello everyone,

After a long silence from us now we are happy to announce that finally the
stable release of KBFX is ready.
We made a lot of changes to the KBFX Configurator and to KBFX Menu itself.
However we were not able to implement everything you proposed and everything we
wanted. So some of the features (see the TODO list in the source files)
in "KBFX Silk" (0.4.9.3.1) are still not ready. We are sure that they will
present in the next stable release which will be due just after KDE4 is
released. The menu itself, however, is fully functional.

Thanks to all of you who gave us ideas and who tested the prerelease versions of
KBFX.

All the best from your KBFX Team. :)
