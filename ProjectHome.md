KBFX is an application written in C++/Qt for KDE 3.2+ and offers an alternative to the default K Logo menu.

It improves users' experience by replacing the Win95-like K-Logo button and menu with a bigger, larger and thus more visible start button and menu. It does however keep the traditional KDE menu as an option. It is fully skinable.
